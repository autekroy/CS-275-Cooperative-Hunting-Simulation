	<strong>Abstract:</strong></p>
<p>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We will have two flocks of well-defined preys and predators. The prey will live together to protect themselves from being captured by the predators. The predator and the prey will be simulated from biologically ground truth. We will simulate the sensors like smell sensors and vision sensors and basic behaviors such as walking, running, ambush, stalking, capturing and escaping. Also, the animats would have different internal states like hunger level which will affect animats&rsquo; behaviors. Additionally, we use a 2D map, in which animats can&rsquo;t jump and cross. This simulated environment will have objects, water source and bushes which can help the lion to camouflage.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this project, we will use the lion as the predator and the zebra as the prey. With predefined escaping strategies of zebras, we will focus on developing cooperative behaviors of lions for hunting an isolated zebra. Based on different number of preys and their positions, we hope lions can learn different hunting pattern like stalking at a greater distance to encircle the prey.</p>
